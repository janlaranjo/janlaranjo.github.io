Hello, my name is Jan Michael Laranjo as you can tell from the title, but everyone calls me Jan.
I am master CS student at the ***University of Technologies Vienna***. Currently I work for 
**s IT Solutions** as a developer in the finance industry.

In my spare time I spend my time with my beloved fiance. We like to travel and love food. Sports
is also another passion, especially hiking. I also love to listen to audio books about personal
development. Furthermore I like to broaden my knowledge by reading books.
