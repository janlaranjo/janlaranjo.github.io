Hello, my name is Jan Michael Laranjo as you can tell from the title, but everyone calls me Jan. 
I am undergraduate CS student at the ***University of Technologies Vienna*** working as a part time Computer programmer for ***MHE & Partners***. 
In my spare time I spend my time with my beloved fiance. We like to travel and love food.
