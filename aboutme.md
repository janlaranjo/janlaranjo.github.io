Hello, my name is Jan Michael Laranjo as you can tell from the title, but everyone calls me Jan.
I am undergraduate CS student at the ***University of Technologies Vienna***. I worked as a part
time computer programmer for ***MHE & Partners*** for more than two years.

In my spare time I spend my time with my beloved fiance. We like to travel and love food. Sports
is also another passion, especially hiking. I also love to listen to audio books about personal
development.
