Hi. As you have noticed, this is my first blog post and I want to take this moment to introduce myself even though I provided a
[resume]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resume.html %}). Finally I want to tell you my intentions for this blog and what I want to write about.

I am nearly done with my undergraduate studies with focus on Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Visualization etc. (Here is a
<a href="http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/angebot/bachelor/medieninformatik-und-visual-computing">link</a> for further informations).
During my studies I did not actually know what my interests in Computer Science lie and recently I discovered the more theoretical field of
Computer Science.(Even though I had some theoretical courses about Algorithms and Data Structures, I wasn't really interested before). There is a vast
number of theoretical fields to discover and to focus on. Do I want to focus on the studies of <i>Algorithms, AI or Complexity theory,</i> etc? I don't
know yet and I want to get to know each field first.

This short insight into my interest of theoretical Computer Science is the main focus of my blog. I want to create some sort of journal for myself
where readers can see my progress becoming better in this wonderful, broad field and also interact and contribute to improve my understandings. I hope
that readers can also take something from this blog. I would be happy, if readers picked something new from this blog.
I want to study different kind of fields, such as <i>Randomized Algorithms, Complexity Classes, First/Second Order Logic, etc</i> and a blog post helps
me to understand the complex theorems better and try to formulate the thesis as easy as possible. In my opinion providing examples of implementations
is also crucial to understand the theoretical and abstract theories.
Also I want to give an update about my undergraduate study from time to time. Maybe I will also write about my life as a computer programmer.

I am not a gifted writer and I would be very pleased, if you can give some constructive criticism or point out mistakes I've made in posts or suggests
improvements in implementations.

I've mentioned it earlier. I am nearly done with my undergraduate studies and I will take many courses this semester. Bear with me. I try my best to
keep this blog up to date. Luckily the courses I've taken this semester are not that time consuming(hopefully) nor difficult.
