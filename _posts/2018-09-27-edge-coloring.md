Recently I watched television and I stumbled across some sport report. Nothing special. It was about football and to be precise about the
<a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/">UEFA Nations League"<a/>. In short terms there exists four leagues(<i>A, B, C, D</i>) with three or four

two times(First and second leg). The goal is to rise up to the highest league <i>A</i>.
