Hey, I haven't been posting for such a long time. So much happened since my last post. Therefore, I want to give you a short 
update in my life. 

First of all, I have a new job as a developer at <a href="https://www.s-itsolutions.at/">s IT Solutions</a>. I felt like I
needed a new challenge in my life and moved on. The company is part of the <a href=" https://www.erstegroup.com/">Erste Group</a>
corporation. They are fintech company. I am now part of the "Branch & Lending" team where I moved to a newly created product team 
that focuses on the online products.

Furthermore I almost finished my bachelor studies. I am almost done with my bachelor thesis. My thesis focuses on serious games.
In particular I developed a serious game prototype, which emphasize on embedding voice training and voice hygiene into the daily
life of users. This is an Android application. It is composed of a training, quiz and a game.

Also I concurrently started with the master studies while finishing my thesis. I switched majors. I moved from "Media Informatics
and Visual Computing" to "Software Engineering and Internet Computing". The reason for that change is that I don't see myself
anymore on this track and furthermore I chose this major in the undergraduate because I only continued these track after highschool.
The focus of master curriculum will be "Internet Computing", "Algorithms" and "Finance". 

I'll try to update more regurarly. My plan is to post more often and try to write some small blog updates.
